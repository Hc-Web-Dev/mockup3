### FSBO Follow-Up Sequence

#### Follow-Up #1 (3 days later)
**Subject**: "Quick question about [PROPERTY_ADDRESS]"

```
Hi [HOMEOWNER_NAME],

I sent you information about a free market analysis for [PROPERTY_ADDRESS] a few days ago.

I'm curious - what's been your biggest challenge so far in selling your home?

Is it:
‚Ä¢ Getting enough qualified showings?
‚Ä¢ Pricing it competitively?
‚Ä¢ Handling negotiations?
‚Ä¢ Managing the paperwork?

I ask because these are the top 4 issues I help homeowners solve every day.

**Quick story**: Last month, [HOMEOWNER_NAME] in [NEIGHBORHOOD] tried selling themselves for 3 months. They had lots of showings but no offers.

Within 2 weeks of listing with me, we had 3 offers and sold for $[AMOUNT] over asking.

The difference? **Strategic pricing and professional marketing.**

If you'd like to chat about your specific situation (no pressure), I'm happy to help.

Hi [HOMEOWNER_NAME],

Just checking in on how the sale of your home is progressing.

I hope you're getting lots of interest!

If you're finding it more challenging than expected, you're not alone. Here are the **3 most common FSBO challenges** I see:

‚Ä¢ FSBO sites reach 12% of buyers
‚Ä¢ MLS reaches 88% of buyers
‚Ä¢ Professional networks add another layer

**2. Pricing Precision**
‚Ä¢ $5,000 overpriced = 50% fewer showings
‚Ä¢ $10,000 overpriced = 75% fewer showings
‚Ä¢ Market timing affects pricing daily

**3. Negotiation Complexity**
‚Ä¢ Average of 7 negotiation points per sale
‚Ä¢ Legal implications of contract terms
‚Ä¢ Inspection and appraisal negotiations

**If any of these resonate**, I'm here to help.

My **"FSBO Transition Program"** includes:
‚Ä¢ No upfront costs

### First-Time Buyer Education Series

#### Email 1: Welcome & Home Buying Process
**Subject**: "Welcome! Your home buying journey starts here üè†"

```
Hi [BUYER_NAME],

Congratulations on taking the first step toward homeownership!

Buying your first home is exciting, but I know it can also feel overwhelming. That's why I've created this email series to guide you through every step.

**Over the next few weeks, you'll learn**:
‚Ä¢ How to get pre-approved (and why it matters)
‚Ä¢ What to look for in different neighborhoods
‚Ä¢ How to make competitive offers in today's market
‚Ä¢ What happens during inspections and appraisals
‚Ä¢ How to prepare for closing day

**Your First Step**: Get Pre-Approved

Before we start looking at homes, let's get you pre-approved for a mortgage. This tells us:
‚Ä¢ Exactly how much you can afford
‚Ä¢ What your monthly payments will be
‚Ä¢ Makes your offers more competitive

**I work with 3 excellent lenders**:
‚Ä¢ [LENDER_1]: Specializes in first-time buyers

#### Email 2: Understanding Pre-Approval
**Subject**: "Pre-approval vs. Pre-qualification: What's the difference?"

```
Hi [BUYER_NAME],

Yesterday I mentioned getting pre-approved. Today, let's dive deeper into what that means and why it's crucial.

**Pre-Qualification vs. Pre-Approval**:

**Pre-Qualification** (Basic):
‚Ä¢ Based on information you provide
‚Ä¢ No document verification
‚Ä¢ Rough estimate only
‚Ä¢ Takes 10-15 minutes

**Pre-Approval** (Comprehensive):
‚Ä¢ Lender verifies income, assets, credit
‚Ä¢ Conditional commitment to lend
‚Ä¢ Specific loan amount approved
‚Ä¢ Takes 1-3 days

**Why Pre-Approval Matters**:
‚úÖ **Serious Buyer Status**: Sellers take your offers seriously
‚úÖ **Faster Closings**: Much of the work is already done
‚úÖ **Negotiation Power**: You can act quickly on good properties
‚úÖ **Budget Clarity**: Know exactly what you can afford

**What You'll Need for Pre-Approval**:
‚Ä¢ Last 2 years of tax returns
‚Ä¢ Recent pay stubs (30 days)
‚Ä¢ Bank statements (2-3 months)
‚Ä¢ List of debts and monthly payments
‚Ä¢ Photo ID

**Common First-Time Buyer Programs**:
‚Ä¢ **FHA Loans**: As little as 3.5% down
‚Ä¢ **VA Loans**: 0% down for veterans
‚Ä¢ **USDA Loans**: 0% down in rural areas
‚Ä¢ **Conventional**: 3% down options available

## Expired Listing Outreach

### Initial Contact Script (Phone)
```
"Hi [HOMEOWNER_NAME], this is [AGENT_NAME] with [COMPANY]. I noticed your home at [ADDRESS] was recently on the market. I'm not calling to ask for the listing - I'm calling because I have some insights about why homes don't sell that might be helpful to you.

**Pause for response**

The three main reasons homes don't sell are pricing, marketing, or timing. In your case, I've done some research and I think I know what happened. Would you be open to a brief conversation about what I found?

**If yes**: Great! I've actually sold [NUMBER] homes in your neighborhood in the past [TIME_PERIOD], including [SPECIFIC_EXAMPLE]. What I've learned is that [SPECIFIC_INSIGHT]. Would you like me to put together a brief analysis of what happened with your listing and what could be done differently?

**If no**: I understand. If you decide to try selling again, I'd be happy to share what I've learned about selling homes in [NEIGHBORHOOD]. Can I send you some information about recent sales in your area?

**Close**: Either way, I'll put together a quick market update for your neighborhood and email it to you. What's the best email address?"
```

### Follow-Up Email After Phone Call
**Subject**: "Market analysis for [PROPERTY_ADDRESS] as promised"

```
Hi [HOMEOWNER_NAME],

As promised, here's the market analysis for your neighborhood and some insights about your recent listing experience.

**What Happened with Your Listing**:
Based on my research, here's what I believe contributed to your home not selling:

‚Ä¢ **Pricing**: Your home was listed at $[PRICE], but recent sales suggest $[SUGGESTED_PRICE] would have generated more activity
‚Ä¢ **Marketing**: [SPECIFIC_OBSERVATION about previous marketing]
‚Ä¢ **Timing**: [MARKET_CONDITION] during your listing period

**Current Market Conditions**:
‚Ä¢ [NUMBER] homes currently for sale in [NEIGHBORHOOD]
‚Ä¢ Average days on market: [DAYS] (down from [PREVIOUS_DAYS] when you were listed)
‚Ä¢ Recent sales: [EXAMPLE_1], [EXAMPLE_2], [EXAMPLE_3]

**If You Decide to Try Again**:
The market has [IMPROVED/CHANGED] since your listing expired. Here's what I would do differently:

1. **Strategic Pricing**: Start at $[RECOMMENDED_PRICE] based on current market data
2. **Enhanced Marketing**: [SPECIFIC_MARKETING_STRATEGIES]
3. **Timing**: List during [OPTIMAL_TIMING] for maximum exposure

**My Track Record in Your Area**:
‚Ä¢ [NUMBER] homes sold in [NEIGHBORHOOD] in the past [TIME_PERIOD]
‚Ä¢ Average days on market: [DAYS]
‚Ä¢ Average sale price to list price ratio: [PERCENTAGE]%
