### Issue: Wrong Tone or Style
**Solution**: Provide tone examples and brand voice guidelines

**Example**: "Write in the tone of [SPECIFIC_BRAND/PERSON], which is characterized by [SPECIFIC_TRAITS]. Here's an example of their writing style: [SAMPLE_TEXT]"

### Issue: Inconsistent Quality
**Solution**: Use templates and systematic approaches

**Template**:
```
Role: [SPECIFIC_EXPERTISE]
Context: [BUSINESS_SITUATION]
Task: [SPECIFIC_REQUEST]
Format: [DESIRED_STRUCTURE]
Constraints: [LIMITATIONS]
Success Criteria: [MEASURABLE_OUTCOMES]
```

2. **Strategy Prompt**: "Based on the analysis above, develop a marketing strategy"
3. **Execution Prompt**: "Create specific tactics to implement this strategy"

### Persona Development

```
